    //It is perfectly fine if we skip below 2 lines, why have we added below 2 lines ?
    //For access pattern, so that it gets easy for us to access products of a category
    //Now, we don't want ORM to consider this relation(association) twice, we have
    //added mappedBy field.

//By default lazy loading , only one query for category ran, no sub-query for getting
//products info ran

//In case we mention c.getProducts , 2 queries will ran

//case6
//@Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)
//@OneToMany(mappedBy = "category", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
//2 queries as it is eager , wthout calling c.getProducts();
//select c1_0.id,c1_0.created_at,c1_0.description,c1_0.last_updated_at,c1_0.name,c1_0.status from category c1_0 where c1_0.id=?
//select p1_0.category_id,p1_0.id,p1_0.created_at,p1_0.description,p1_0.image_url,p1_0.last_updated_at,p1_0.price,p1_0.status,p1_0.title from product p1_0 where p1_0.category_id=?

//CASE 5 AND 6 SUBSELECT BEHAVE SIMILAR TO SELECT

//Using SELECT indicates that the property should be loaded lazily.
//FetchMode.JOIN loads them eagerly
//We can only use SUBSELECT with collections.

//if the code doesn’t set FetchMode, the default one is JOIN and FetchType works as defined
//with FetchMode.SELECT or FetchMode.SUBSELECT set, FetchType also works as defined
//with FetchMode.JOIN set, FetchType is ignored and a query is always eager
